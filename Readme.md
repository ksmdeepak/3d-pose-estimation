### Object Location Prediction

Predict the (x, y, z) coordinates of an object in a 3D space using Neural Nets.

This is a [video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qhQqtsi-LOZvC7b0jeh7oTjYbFtSHBi3) showing the working of the model in real time. 
We piped the predictions(x, y, z) made by the Neural Net into a Holo Lens to generate a virtual object(red sphere) at the position predicted by the NN.
